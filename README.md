# ffxiv-mitigation-overlay
The purpose of this tool is to provide an alternative overlay focused only on tank mitigations.
This helps to separate the buffs into a separate area to make them easier to view and track.
The bars also offer a convenient way of estimating the time remaining without having to read any values.

## Requirements and installation.

This is an addon for ACT, so [ACT itself is required](https://advancedcombattracker.com/download.php) and [must already be set up](https://github.com/ravahn/FFXIV_ACT_Plugin).

## Screenshots

Working on it

## F.A.Q

### Will this addon need to be updated when ACT or the game updates?

Nope! Well, incredibly infrequently. Everything is self contained. The only updates that will be required are when new mitigations are added to the game

Previous versions will continue to work just fine (except they won't display any new skills).

### Will this addon scale to my resolution?

Yup! Everything is programmed in a way to be responsive, just scale the area to whatever size you want athe bars will adjust accordingly

### Are those bars curved?

Sure are, they were the hardest part of the project, thanks for asking.

### Which jobs or skills are supported?

Currently every tank's personal and shared mitigation will work.
